# Chapter 2 - Statisical Learning

## What is Statistical Learning?

* Input variables are typically denoted with the symbol *X*, with a subscript to distinguish them
   * e.g., *X<sub>1</sub>* might be the "TV" budget, *X<sub>2</sub>* the "Radio" budget, *X<sub>3</sub>* the "Newpaper" budger.
* Inputs go by different names - *predictors*, *independent variables*, *features*, *variables*
* Output variable - e.g., "Sales" - is often called the *response* or *dependent variable*
* Output variable typically denoted with the symbol *Y*

* __Generally, assume that we observe a quantitative response *Y* and *p* different *predictors*, *X<sub>1</sub>*,*X<sub>2</sub>*,...,*X<sub>p</sub>*. We assume that there is some relationship between *Y* and *X* = (*X<sub>1</sub>*,*X<sub>2</sub>*,...,*X<sub>p</sub>*), which can be written in the very general form: *Y* = f(*X*) + e__
